abstract = {A distinct change in lithofacies was observed from red clay to siliceous ooze in a core from Indian Ocean. Radiolarian index species were used to ascertain the Quaternary datum levels and an age of 2.0 Ma is determined up to 125 cm depth from surface. Below 185 cm depth, the sediment core lacked radiolarian test completely. At about 50 cm from core top, the sedimentation rate decreased drastically from 0.18 to 0.05 cm/kyr with a corresponding age of 500 kyr, marking Marine Isotope Stage 13. The changes in lithofacies and sedimentation rate are further accompanied by the change in clay mineralogy from smectite rich older sediments to smectite depleted younger sediments and presence of higher amount of volcanogenic materials in the older sediments. Higher values of chemical index of alteration (CIA) and lower K2O/Al2O3 in older sediments indicate dominance of chemical weathering in the older sediments which decreased gradually towards core top. Ti normalized concentrations of elements like Co, V, Cu, Ni, Ce, Y and âˆ‘REEs exhibit lowest values at the transition zone above which the ratios increased steadily towards the core top. All these observations indicate a marked change in the climatic regime from late Quaternary onwards, prior to which the environment was less bio-productive.}

abstract = {The presence of nanoplastics in the environment has been proven. There is now an urgent need to determine how nanoplastics behave in the environment and to assess the risks they may pose. Here, we examine nanoplastic homo- and heteroaggregation, with a focus on environmentally relevant nanoplastic particle models. We made a systematic analysis of experimental studies, and ranked the environmental relevance of 377 different solution chemistries, and 163 different nanoplastic particle models. Since polymer latex spheres are not environmentally relevant (due to their monodisperse size, spherical shape, and smooth surface), their aggregation behavior in natural conditions is not transferable to nanoplastics. A few recent studies suggest that nanoplastic particle models that more closely mimic incidentally produced nanoplastics follow different homoaggregation pathways than latex sphere particle models. However, heteroaggregation of environmentally relevant nanoplastic particle models has seldom been studied. Despite this knowledge gap, the current evidence suggests that nanoplastics may be more sensitive to heteroaggregation than previously expected. We therefore provide an updated hypothesis about the likely environmental fate of nanoplastics. Our review demonstrates that it is essential to use environmentally relevant nanoplastic particle models, such as those produced with top-down methods, to avoid biased interpretations of the fate and impact of nanoplastics. Finally, it will be necessary to determine how the heteroaggregation kinetics of nanoplastics impact their settling rate to truly understand nanoplastics' fate and effect in the environment.}
