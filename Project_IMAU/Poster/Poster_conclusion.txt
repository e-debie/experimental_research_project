Conclusion:
The nanoplastics we detected deeper in the sediment could not have been deposited during the formation of those sediment layers. We must therefore conclude that they were brought there by a perturbation. Whether this was by biological, geophysical or human means (during the procurement of the sediment) we cannot say.
We do not know why PVC specifically seems to be more likely to be transported deeper into the sediment compared to other types of nanoplastics. PS accounts for a disproportionate fraction of the nanoplastics found in the top layer of the sediment. This could indicate a higher likelihood for PS to aggregate.
