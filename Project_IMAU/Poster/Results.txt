The nanoplastic concentration is lower when going deeper in the sea floor, which makes sense.
Remarkably, there is also still a in comparison significant amount of nanoplastics in the deeper layers, which were formed (tens of) thousands of years ago. 
There are relatively large amounts of PS in the sediment closest to the surface.
Interestingly, the PVC concentration seems to increase when going deeper into the sea floor.
